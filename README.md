A base pack of addons and config files for standard Zesty projects.

To install or upgrade into a Zesty app run `ember install`, with the desired version number.

```
yarn upgrade ember-cli-zesty-app-base
ember generate ember-cli-zesty-app-base
```

Avoid using `ember install` as it will lock the app base to a specific version rather than a range.

Note that when you're upgrading you will probs need to run generators for individual packages, e.g. see https://github.com/zestyzesty/ember-cli-deploy-zesty-pack for specific instructions.
